## :white_medium_square: Description
### Week 9 Final Exercise
### This exercise called Real Time Bus Tracker shows all the bus stops between the MIT campus and the Harvard campus. By solving this exercise we practiced on the DOM manipulation along with the animation of Maps.

## :white_medium_square: How to run
### Once you load the page on your browser, click on the "Show Bus Stops" button. And then you will see how the pin marked starts moving showing the bus stops.


## :white_medium_square: Roadmap of future improvements
### This exercise has many ways to e improved, the first one that comes to my mind is adding the information of the time that takes from one stop to the next one.
